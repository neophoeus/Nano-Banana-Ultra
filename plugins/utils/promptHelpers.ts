5. You may return either one dense prompt paragraph or 2-4 short prompt-only blocks separated by line breaks when segmentation improves detail, clarity, or fidelity.
6. Every line or paragraph must remain pure prompt content ready to send directly to an image model.

4. Output a plain-text multi-section brief in this exact order: Scene Overview, Subjects and Composition, Visual Details, Lighting and Color, Mood and Style, Final Prompt.
5. Use naturally translated section headings and body text in ${languageName}.
6. Each section must contain concrete visual evidence from the image, not generic filler.
7. Preserve what is actually visible instead of inventing unrelated elements.
8. If a requested detail is uncertain or only weakly supported, say it is unclear, subtle, likely, or not significant rather than presenting it as certain.
9. If text in the image is unreadable, describe it as illegible rather than guessing.
10. In Scene Overview, establish the environment, overall scale, genre or era cues, and any visible creative twist that reframes the scene.
11. In Subjects and Composition, identify the main subject first, then secondary subjects or supporting figures if present; describe visual hierarchy, composition structure, and the visible camera angle or lens feel.
12. In Visual Details, describe secondary elements, materials, textures, micro-details, visible depth-of-field behavior, and any hidden details that are truly present on closer inspection. If no significant hidden details are visible, say so rather than inventing them.
13. In Lighting and Color, describe light source behavior, shadow character, atmospheric depth, palette logic, color temperature, and dominant or accent colors.
14. In Mood and Style, describe the emotional tone, style fusion, and rendering finish. Mood should capture feeling or narrative charge, while rendering finish should capture the observable medium, polish, or surface treatment.
15. In Final Prompt, write one polished generation-ready prompt paragraph that synthesizes the observations without repeating the section labels.
